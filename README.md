# codra-rst-parser

**THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED!**

If you simply want to install and run the CODRA RST parser (using Docker),
please use [NLPbox/codra-docker](https://github.com/NLPbox/codra-docker).
For even more convenience, check out [NLPbox/codra-service](https://github.com/NLPbox/codra-service),
which offers a REST API for the parser.

If you are interested in seeing graphical output of your parse trees,
need to convert between different RST file formats
and/or would like to use other RST parsers as well, check out
[arne-cl/rst-workbench](https://github.com/arne-cl/rst-workbench for an overview).

The original CODRA source code is still available on [Shafiq Joty's old website](http://alt.qcri.org/tools/discourse-parser/),
but I needed to make some changes to get the parser running.
My fork (including all models / large files) is available in the [codra-rst-parser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codra-rst-parser/)
repo on sourceforge. (I couldn't host them on Github because of its
restrictions for large files.)
